            <h2>HOLM OUTDOOR FITNESS</h2>
            <p>
              The focus was on developing a well-functioning website, that
              solved the companys current issues with a booking system and the
              lack of male presence. To solve this, we started with research and
              insights and turned this information into well-programmed
              functioning site, where it was possible to book and see where and
              when to attend a fitness class and filter between trainers and
              form of training. To enhance male presence, we included events, so
              it would be a fun and comfortable experience for all to come and
              be a part of a training community. The site was programmed with
              HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which made it possible to achieve a
              website, that Holm Outdoor Fitness wanted to implement, after we
              presented the final result.

            <h2>INTERACTIVE STORYTELLING</h2>
            <p>
              A Collaboration with Steno Museum at Aarhus University, where the
              assignment was to create an interactive version of their current
              exhibitions, with focus on storytelling. Here my group and I chose
              the theme: Body image through time and created a fun a different
              experience with sounds, animations and characters. Through this
              storytelling it was important to have a tone of voice that
              enhanced the viewers excitement, by talking in a fun and involving
              voice while still being trustworthy with real information. The
              interactive site was programmed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

            <h2>NIPPON</h2>
            <p>
              A tailored meal box solution inspired by Japanese culture, where
              the whole family could get together about making dinner and save
              time, by getting it delivered to the door. To enhance the number
              of customers, we turned insights into data, which created the
              foundation of our website. By using real people for interviews and
              test, it was possible develop a site, that people found inspiring,
              by including a visual identity through the whole page, and made it
              easy for families to choose their meal box for the week, as well
              as shopping other necessary grocery items. We used pictures to
              create a welcoming feeling and made a logo that was easy to
              recognize. The site was programmed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
